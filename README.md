### Anderson's/Fisher's Iris Data Set for analysing in Python

The analysis is presented in two files. The Jupiter Notebook file is slightly different from the content of the analysis.py file. 
1. In the .py file, the dataset is loaded from a local folder. The Jupiter Notebook file uses the URL link method. Therefore, the “spicies” column in Jupiter Notebook is the same as “class” column in the dataset of the .py file.

2. Information in Jupiter Notebook file is more text informative and visual, while in the .py file, analysis tasks are solved in a more optimized way.
